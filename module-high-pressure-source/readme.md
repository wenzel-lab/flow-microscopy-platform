## Air pressure source module to supply positive pressure to the regulation system

Module to supply needed air pressure to the workstation. 
Depending on planned experiments the pressure can be low (<= 1 bar) or higher (up to 6? bar).

This is an optional module that can be added to the pressure regulator system.  
It is not needed in the case of a steady and well regulated pressure source that can be connected to the instrument via "standard" (define!) tubing (from a gas bottle with regulator or steady pressure line).

### simple manual regulation module

If the used pressure source is either unsteady (simple compressor; gas line with other users) or too strong (some gas lines; etc.), this module could consist of an attachable "simple" mechanic, manual pressure regulator and a pressure display, perhaps also a pressure buffer/container (such as this https://www.festo.com/cat/de_de/products_080200#).

### portable mini-gass bottle module

The module could provide a compact and portable pressure solution using a small gas bottle.
Such a module needs
* An high-quality (= little leaks) attachment port for small gas bottles (e.g. larger CO2 cartridges for bike tire inflation https://reviews.mtbr.com/inflation-chart-for-different-tire-sizes-and-co2-sizes, or small ones for sparkling drinks).
* An outlet pressure regulator (manual)
* A pressure display
* Potentially another small pressure container to buffer and provide a steady target pressure to the digital regulator module of the workstation.

A disadvantage is that a new gas bottle is needed regularly, perhaps even for every experiment / day. It is also not clear how equal the pressure in various products can be expected to be.

On the positive side this would easily facilitate anaerobic work, since CO2 or N2 gas bottles would be used.

### Manually re-fillable pressure resarvoir 

Instead of the mini-gas bottle attachement, one could imagine a pressure resarviour that can be refilled with a manual hand/foot pump before long experiments.
Desired pressures are easily acheivable by cheap standard manual pumps, but not by micro-air pumps that could fit into the design.
To keep the workstation compact, a compact reservoir could be refilled by a standard pump. The pumps are more bulky, but would be removed before esperimentation.

This could be a cheap ans sustainable solution, with the disadvantage that the pressured gas can only be air.
