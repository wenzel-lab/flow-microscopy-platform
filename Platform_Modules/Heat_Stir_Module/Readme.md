## Heat and Stear Module

For instance, the microfluid stage needs to be heated or the sample needs to be stared while kept warm, for this there is the need for 2 heaters and stirring components.

These components share the same base, a 5.5 cm diameter metal plate, for this a modular system that allows these 4 components to be enclosed together while minimizing space was implemented. This works with base pillars that have a design compatible with the [Modular Tube Holders](https://www.printables.com/model/514591-moldular-tube-holders) used by LibreHub, and that using the same stage legs from the microscopy stage allows for the assembling of multiple  floors  using an acrylic plate of 5 or 6 mm as support.
