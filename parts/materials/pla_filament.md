# PLA filament

The microscope design has been tested using PLA filament only. PLA is the most common 3D printer filament. It is easy to use and has low part shrinkage. We have found that the lifetime of the microscope is affected by the quality of the PLA filament, as such we recommend buying high quality filament and storing the filament in a dry sealed container before printing.
