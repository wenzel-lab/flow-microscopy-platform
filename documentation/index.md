# Flow Microscopy Platform

Welcome to the documentation for the **Flow Microscopy Platform**! This is a modular open-source platform for microfluidic operations, especially in droplet microfluidic experiments.  

**Why a Flow Microscopy Platform?**

Traditional techniques for studying microbial communities are usually labor-intensive and have limited applications. Microfluidics, particularly droplet microfluidics, provides a new, rapid, high-resolution way of performing biological studies while reducing cross-contamination and reagent consumption. Despite the advantages of droplet microfluidics, experimental setups typically rely on bulky and costly benchtop equipment containing various complex components and interfaces to control and monitor workflows, thereby limiting the adoption and benefits of this technique from the global scientific community. Although manufacturers offer new alternatives, the use of proprietary standards limits their integration and interoperability in droplet microfluidic workstations.

**What is the Flow Microscopy Platform?**

This platform comprises three ready-to-use modules: an imaging system for fast-imaging droplets, an infusion system for multiphase fluid manipulation, and a heating system for localized temperature control.
