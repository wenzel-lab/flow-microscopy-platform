# Flow Microscopy Platform

Our open hardware flow microscopy platform is a more comprehensive version of our [open-source strobe-enhanced microscopy stage](https://github.com/wenzel-lab/strobe-enhanced-microscopy-stage) (build instructions [here](https://wenzel-lab.github.io/strobe-enhanced-microscopy-stage/)), including the control of pressure, flow and temperature in 4-channels. The platform is controlled by "Rio", [our modular microfluidics controller boards and firmware](https://github.com/wenzel-lab/rio-controller). Working with pressurized gas, regulators, and flow sensors allows for a compact, faster, and more precise flow control compared to syringe pumps, such as our [3D printed syringe pumps with controller](https://github.com/wenzel-lab/syringe-pumps-and-controller). In contrast to other open-source platforms and some commercial platforms, our implementation is capable of handling high-pressures (up to 6 bar) in order to process gels and more viscous liquids.



Before you start building the station, you will need to source all the components listed in our [bill of materials]{BOM} page. , which is given on the next page.

## Instructions
These instructions will take you through how to assemble the flow microscopy platform.

The assembly is described in several steps:
